                <p>Before attending Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program, I was working in accounting as my first post-college job. After working for around a year and a half, I decided I wanted to switch careers to a field I had more interest in. Having grown up around computers and in Silicon Valley, my interests have always been in tech, which made pursuing a career in software engineering a natural switch for me. I am excited to apply my skills to technology that improves peopleâ€™s lives while also continuing to improve and learn from others.</p>
