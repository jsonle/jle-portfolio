                            Before attending Flatiron School's immersive software engineering program, 
                            I was working in accounting as my first post-college job. After working for 
                            around a year and a half, I decided I wanted to switch careers to a field I 
                            had more interest in. Having grown up around computers and in Silicon Valley, 
                            my interests have always been in tech, which made pursuing a career in software 
                            engineering a natural switch for me. I am excited to apply my skills to technology
                            that improves peopleâ€™s lives while also continuing to improve and learn from others.
